### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is James, I'm a mechanical engineering at Jacobs Engineering - aspiring to learn more about the world of Data Science, Machine Learning, and programming in general. 


The start of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown sparked my interest in programming and since then it has been non-stop - Before April 2020 I couldn't write a single line of code!

When I'm not programming I like to ski, surf, hike, and climb.
